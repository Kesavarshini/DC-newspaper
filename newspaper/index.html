                <h2>It's time for a concensus on national caste census</h2>
                <p><strong class="p">P</strong>lacing the socio-economic data derived from the country's first caste census, Bihar Chief minister Nitish Kumar made a clarion call for raising the bar on quota, currently pegged at 50 percent by a Supreme Court diktat but breached in states like Tamilnadu and Telangana. The fear is that there can be no limit on reservation once the ceiling is lifted may be real, but that should not deter the gathering of data from a national caste census.</p>
                <p><strong>In the light of what the data is showing up now, reservations have not only to stay but also be extended... The accurate data can never be underestimated.</strong></p>
                <p>There would have to be a national consensus among political parties that a caste census is deemed necessary as caste inequality must be measured so that welfare programmes can target the lesser served people better. Only then would the requisite majority be found to breach the limits on reservations, like the 75 percent ceiling that Nitish Kumar seeks now. The importance of accurate data can never be underestimated as it will also show if the benefits of reservations are being cornered, as is suspected. But first get the national caste census done. However much India would like to be a casteless society, caste identifiers exist and they can be used to bring out persisting inequalities and find ways to address them.</p>

                <p><strong class="p">W</strong>hen Egypt's president Anwar Sadat and Israel's Prime minister Menachem Begin won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978, Golda Meir, Israel's former prime minister, commented that they should get Oscars instead. Also revealing was Benjamin Netanyahu's confession to his Likud party, reported in the New York Times of October 22, 2023 that a strong and rich Hamas would kill all dreams of a Palestinian state. "This is a part of our strategy", the latter-day Machiavelli disclosed.</p>
                <p>Some well wishing commentators wonder why the Palestinians did not offer non violent passive resistance. The answer is that they were not allowed. In 1988, Israel expelled a Palestinian Christian pacifist activist, Mubarak Awad, who advocated Gandhian style resistance. At the same time, Yasin was allowed to circulate anti-Jewish hate literature and call for Israel's destruction by force. US policy was similarly duplicitous. Until 1993, American consular officials in Jerusalem periodically met Hamas leader but were forbidden to meet PLO officials or leading moderates in Arafat's coalition although the PLO had renounced terrorism and unilaterally recognised Israel as far back as 1988.</p>

                <p>In a startling reversal, the Modi Sarkar has disavowed its own 30 degree appraisal system for senior civil servants. So, why this vote-face? The government's new found denial of the system is a puzzling and concerning development and will be seen as signifying lack of consistency and willingness to change fundamental procedures without clear rationale.</p>

                <p>Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar apologised on Wednesday for his controversial remarks on women's education and population control.

                <p>"I apologise and take back my words. I am ashamed of what I have said and tender my apology," Kumar said in the state Assembly Besides both Houses of the Legislature, the Bihar Chief Minister expressed regrets over his Tuesday's remarks outside the Vidhan SAbha as well.

                  <p><i>"Kitna neeche giroge?"</i> he asked. Speaking at the rallis, Modi said that he is determined to continue his crusade against corruption in the country, which he had launched when he became the Prime Minister in 2014. "You abuse me. You do whatever you like. But, Modi will continue his crusade against corruption," he dared the Congress. The Prime Minister cautioned the people against the congress.</p>

                            <p><strong>Baghdad, Nov.8: </strong> The "extreme" drought gripping Iraq, Syria and Iran would not have occurred without climate change caused primarily by burning fossil fuels, scientists said on Wednesday, warning that punishing dry spells will become more intense as the warms. </p>
                            <p>Rising temperatures in coming years threaten to evaporate much of the region's precipitation, according to Rahimi. "We anticipate that we will have more evaporation and transpiration from plants so am not so optimistic for future," he added. In Iraq and in Syria, journalists regularly observe the repercussions of climate change.</p>

            <p><strong>Pune, Nov.8: </strong> Ben Stokes Maiden World Cup hundred-set up a 160-run win for England over the Neitherlands in Pune on the Wednesday as the struggling champions climbed off the bottom of the table. Victory ended a five-game losing streak with England having long since ceased to be in semi final contention.</p>
            <p>But just their second win of the 10-team tournament maintained England's hopes of the top-eight finish that would qualify them for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. England were in trouble at 192/6 after yet another batting collapse before Strokes 108 and 54 from fellow all-rounder Chris Woaakes took them to 339/9 in 50 overs. England, however, lost two wickets in quick succession. Joe Root fell for 28 in bizarre ashion when bowled between his legs by Logan van Beek attempting a reverse scoop.</p>
